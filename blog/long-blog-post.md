As the customer-led energy transition upends the status quo of one-way distribution networks, there is a need for new tools and approaches to analyse, plan and monitor the distribution system.
The Energy Workbench provides a platform that combines relevant network model information into a single source, breaking the traditional siloed storage of critical network data.

Conventionally, to model the electrical performance of the network a web of disparate sources of network information would be patched together with broad-based assumptions and averages, leaving valuable network capacity unreported and unused.
By combining information such as:

-Network connectivity models,

-Electrical asset characteristics,

-Switch states, network loading and

-Customer connection relationships

The Energy Workbench enables team members to work directly with data that supports improved network planning and operation. Reducing unnecessary and error-prone extraction, transformation and loading of data to answer vital questions likeâ€¦
